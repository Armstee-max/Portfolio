        <h2>Donald Armstrong</h2>
        <p>
          I am a passionate frontend developer from Ikot Ekpene, Akwa Ibom,
          Nigeria. Currently, I am honing my skills at Future Labs, where I
          embrace every opportunity to expand my knowledge and expertise in web
          development.
        </p>
        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <p>
          My path in technology began with a curiosity about how websites work
          and a desire to create digital experiences that leave an impact. As a
          frontend developer, I focus on translating design concepts into
          functional, responsive, and visually appealing interfaces. Every line
          of code I write is aimed at creating seamless user experiences that
          bridge the gap between technology and human interaction.
        </p>
        <h2>Skills & Expertise</h2>
        <p>My technical toolkit includes proficiency in:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript</li>
          <li>Modern frontend frameworks and libraries</li>
          <li>Responsive web design principles</li>
          <li>UI/UX fundamentals</li>
          <li>Version control systems</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I am particularly passionate about creating clean, efficient code that
          not only works flawlessly but is also maintainable and scalable.
        </p>
        <h2>Learning & Growth</h2>
        <p>
          At Future Labs, I have been immersed in a dynamic learning environment
          that pushes me to think creatively and solve complex problems. This
          experience has been instrumental in shaping my approach to development
          and strengthening my technical foundation. I believe in continuous
          learning and staying updated with the latest trends and technologies
          in the ever-evolving field of web development. Each project presents
          new challenges and learning opportunities that I eagerly embrace.
        </p>
        <h2>My Nigerian Roots</h2>
        <p>
          Coming from Ikot Ekpene in Akwa Ibom State, I carry with me the rich
          cultural heritage and resilient spirit of Nigeria. This background has
          instilled in me values of hard work, creativity, and determination â€“
          qualities that I bring to every project I undertake.
        </p>
        <h2>Vision & Goals</h2>
        <p>
          Through this portfolio website, I aim to showcase my skills, document
          my growth journey, and connect with like-minded professionals in the
          tech community. I aspire to contribute meaningfully to the digital
          landscape, creating solutions that make a difference and inspire
          others. I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead in my
          development career and look forward to taking on new challenges that
          will further refine my craft. Let's build something amazing together!
